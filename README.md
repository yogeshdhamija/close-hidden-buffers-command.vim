# close-hidden-buffers-command.vim

A command to close hidden buffers. See `:help CloseHiddenBuffers` once installed, or see the `doc/` directory.

Also works with the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) plugin, '[VSCode Neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)'. There, it performs the analogous action of clearing the open editors.

To install:
- Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): `Plug 'yogeshdhamija/close-hidden-buffers-command.vim'`
